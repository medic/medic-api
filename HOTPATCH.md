# HOTPATCH IS IN EFFECT

This server has been hotpatched, in an attempt to solve unique performance issues in a situation where we are unable to deploy newer software by traditional means.

Changes to this repo compared to the 2.13.x base installation are described and up to date in this PR: https://github.com/medic/medic-api/pull/213

This in theory should match what is on the server, but deployment is occurring via patches (as opposed to git) so it's not a certainty.
